    <h1>Make a basic database in MySQL</h1>

    <p>
        Give the pets and the owners an "id" with the following line: <br><br>
        id INT AUTO-INCREMENT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, </p>
    <p>Now you can make a relationship between certain owners and pets</p>

    <h1>Add the use statement, and Owners needs to be above pets. (for Hiearchy in the function)</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Give the pets the following lines so that they have an ID:</p>
    <br>
    <p>owner_id INT NOT NULL</p>
    <p>FOREIGN KEY (owner_id) REFERENCES owners(id)</p>
    <br>
    <p>"NOT NULL" means every pet must have an owner. There are no pets without owners in this databse</p>

    <h1>Now we want to get information about Buster's Owner, John Doe. We want his name email and phone number. We need
        a join query for this.</h1>

    <hr>
    <h1>Now to try a different type of join, we have to create a second owner. Create Jane Doe.</h1>
    <p>Make the following changes to the code:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>change the inner join to left join. Result: nothing different, because there is no such thing as a pet that
            does not have an owner id.</li>
        <li>Now swap out the owners and pets. Change from pets to from owners and left join owners to left join pets.
            Result: in this case there is an owner that doesn't have a pet. So it will show NULL for all the pet fields,
            but it will show Jane Doe's info.</li>
        <li>Now use the same example above and switch to a right join.  Result:  nothing will come up because there is not a single pet without an owner.</li>
    </ul>
